# DocumentDB-REST #

Microsoft Azure's DocumentDB is a great PaaS NoSQL database.  It supports Stored Procedures, User Defined Functions (UDF) and Triggers. A REST API is directly available, but a API Connector is not available.  This project started off as an API Connector. 

I started off trying to duplicate all the DocumentDB published REST API in Swagger. I used SwaggerHub to author the Swagger JSON file.
I then using the **Add REST API** function in VS 2015 to generate the code for my API Application.
